		<p><b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). </p><img src="pto.jpg">
		<p>The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p> 
		<p>The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. </p>
		<br>
		<p> <b>Computers</b> do not understand the languages we talk or write. There should be a medium language which should understandble to the Computer as well as us. That is why Programming Languages are created.</p><img src="pol.png">
		<p>We created games, webpages, softwares, useful applications using the programming languages. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it). </p>
		<p>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (such as C) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>
